# Network-Model
> For this project, I have collaborated with two of my colleagues to write a chapter on “Network Model” for Operations Research. Here, we have created 10 basic problems based on the network model. It includes the minimum Spanning tree, maximal flow, and shortest route problems. We have performed several traditional methods and algorithmic solutions based on our requirements. <br>
