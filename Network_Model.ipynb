Here, Network flow problems can be taken as an example, as it involves the transportation of goods and material across a network like railway system. We can represent a network flow with the help of graph whose nodes are cities & whose arcs are rail lines between them. They are called flows because they possess same property of the water which are flowing through a network of pipes.\n",

Shortest route problem is a particular network model problem which has received a great deal of attention for both the practical and theoretical reasons. For instance, given a network with a distance associated with each arc, this network model helps us to find the shortest distance from origin (source) to the destination (which is called sink).\n",
