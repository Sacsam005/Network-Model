Shortest route problem is a network model problem which has received a great deal of attention for both the practical and theoretical reasons. For instance, given a network with a distance associated with each arc, this network model helps us to find the shortest distance from origin (source) to the destination (which is called sink).\n",

        ">These problems can be formulated in real life problems like equipment replacement, capital, investment, project scheduling, and inventory planning. The theoretical interest of this problem is due to the efficient solution problems. Shortest route problems can be interpreted as a network problem very easily. \n",

In which we must identify all the paths and then we must sum of all the distances of specific path. Then the path has less distance it will be considered as the shortest route. \n",
